Packmol - Creates Initial Configurations for Molecular Dynamics Simulations

**https://m3g.github.io/packmol**

## What is Packmol

Packmol creates an initial point for molecular dynamics simulations by packing molecules in defined regions of space. The packing guarantees that short range repulsive interactions do not disrupt the simulations.

The great variety of types of spatial constraints that can be attributed to the molecules, or atoms within the molecules, makes it easy to create ordered systems, such as lamellar, spherical or tubular lipid layers.

The user must provide only the coordinates of one molecule of each type, the number of molecules of each type and the spatial constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy.

The package is compatible with input files of PDB, TINKER, XYZ and MOLDY formats.

## Usage

User guide, examples, and tutorials, are available at: https://m3g.github.io/packmol

## Installation instructions

### Downloading

1. Download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` files of the latest version from: https://github.com/m3g/packmol/releases

2. Unpack the files, for example with: 
   ```bash
   tar -xzvf packmol-20.13.0.tar.gz
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   unzip -xzvf packmol-20.13.0.zip
   ```
   substituting the `20.13.0` with the correct version number.

### Using `make`

3. Go into the `packmol` directory, and compile the package (we assume `gfortran` or other compiler is available):
    ```bash
    cd packmol
    ./configure [optional: path to fortran compiler]
    make
    ```

4. An executable called `packmol` will be created in the main directory. Add that directory to your path.

### Using the Fortran Package Manager (`fpm`)

3. Install the Fortran Package Manager from: https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/install/index.html#install

4. Go into the `packmol` directory, and run:
   ```bash
   fpm install --profile release
   ```
   this will compile and send the executable somewhere in your `PATH`.
   By default (on Linux systems) it will be `~/.local/bin`. Making it available
   as a `packmol` command anywhere in your computer.

   `fpm` will look for Fortran compilers automatically and will use `gfortran`
   as default. To use another compiler modify the environment variable
   `FPM_FC=compiler`, for example for `ifort`, use in bash, `export FPM_FC=ifort`.
